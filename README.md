## 🚀 Quick Start — Run Locally

1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cortex-portfolio.git
cd cortex-portfolio
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser (works without a server). For a local dev server (recommended):

```bash
# using python
python -m http.server 8000
# or using node + serve
npx serve .
```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8000` and enjoy.

## 🔧 File Overview

```
/ (project root)
├─ index.html            # main HTML

## ✅ Accessibility & Best Practices

* Semantic `<section>` tags with IDs for deep links and screen readers
* Keyboard controls for the skills cube (Arrow keys)
* Forms use `required` attributes and friendly placeholder text
* Contrast-friendly color variables for light & dark themes
